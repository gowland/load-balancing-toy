# Cloud Computing Fundamentals

Cloud computing delivers computing services over the internet, providing scalable resources on-demand without requiring physical hardware management.

## Service Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.

**Examples:** Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure Virtual Machines

**Use Cases:**
- Virtual machines and storage
- Network and security management
- Backup and disaster recovery
- High-performance computing

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications.

**Examples:** Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Service

**Use Cases:**
- Web application development
- API development and management
- Database services
- Development frameworks and tools

### Software as a Service (SaaS)
Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.

**Examples:** Salesforce, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365

**Use Cases:**
- Email and collaboration tools
- Customer relationship management
- Enterprise resource planning
- Content management systems

## Deployment Models

### Public Cloud
Services offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them.

### Private Cloud
Services maintained on a private network and dedicated to a single organization.

### Hybrid Cloud
Combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

### Multi-Cloud
Use of multiple cloud computing services from different providers.
