# Code Review Best Practices

Code reviews are a crucial part of the software development process, helping maintain code quality, share knowledge, and catch issues before they reach production.

## Benefits of Code Reviews

### Quality Assurance
- Catch bugs and logic errors early
- Ensure coding standards compliance
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Verify requirements implementation

### Knowledge Sharing
- Spread domain knowledge across team
- Learn new techniques and approaches
- Understand different parts of codebase
- Mentoring junior developers

### Team Collaboration
- Foster discussions about design decisions
- Build consensus on technical approaches
- Improve team communication
- Create shared ownership of code

## Code Review Process

### 1. Preparation
- Keep changes focused and small
- Write clear commit messages
- Include context and reasoning in PR description
- Self-review before requesting review

### 2. Review Guidelines

- Ask questions to understand reasoning

### 3. Response and Resolution
- Address feedback professionally
- Explain decisions when clarification needed
- Make requested changes or discuss alternatives
- Re-request review after significant changes

## What to Look For

### Code Quality
- Readability and maintainability
- Proper error handling
- Performance implications
- Test coverage and quality

### Design and Architecture
- Adherence to established patterns
- Proper separation of concerns
- API design and interfaces
- Scalability considerations

### Security and Safety

- Authentication and authorization
- Sensitive data handling
- Potential security vulnerabilities

## Review Tools and Techniques

### Pull Request Platforms
- GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- Inline comments and suggestions
- Approval workflows
- Automated checks integration

### Automated Checks
- Linting and code formatting
- Unit test execution
- Security scanning
- Code coverage analysis

## Best Practices

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Recognize good code and improvements
- Balance thoroughness with efficiency
