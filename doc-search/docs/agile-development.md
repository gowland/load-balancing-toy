# Agile Software Development

Agile is a methodology that emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility in responding to change. It values individuals and interactions over processes and tools.

## Core Values

### 1. Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
While processes and tools are important, the focus should be on people and how they work together.

### 2. Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
Documentation is valuable, but working software that meets user needs takes priority.

### 3. Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
Active customer involvement throughout the development process leads to better outcomes.

### 4. Responding to Change over Following a Plan
Flexibility to adapt to changing requirements and market conditions.
