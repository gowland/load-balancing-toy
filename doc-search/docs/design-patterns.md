# Design Patterns in Software Engineering

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They represent best practices and provide a shared vocabulary for developers.

## Categories of Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
Handle object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance
- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying exact classes
- **Builder**: Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects

### Structural Patterns
Deal with object composition and relationships between objects.

- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Decorator**: Adds new functionality to objects dynamically
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- **Observer**: Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects

### Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication between objects and the assignment of responsibilities.

- **Strategy**: Encapsulates algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- **Command**: Encapsulates requests as objects
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes

## Benefits

- Proven solutions to recurring problems
- Improved code reusability and maintainability
- Enhanced communication between developers
- Faster development through established patterns

## When to Use

Use design patterns when you encounter problems they're designed to solve, but avoid over-engineering simple solutions.
